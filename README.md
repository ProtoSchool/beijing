# [ARCHIVED] ProtoSchool Beijing


*******************************

### THIS REPO IS NO LONGER IN USE AND HAS BEEN ARCHIVED.

This repo has been archived as part of the transition to ProtoSchool's new local event leadership model, [announced](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/issues/84) in March of 2020. If this group is still hosting ProtoSchool workshops, they'll be listed on our events page.

**Please visit our [events page](https://proto.school/#/events) to find upcoming workshops near you** and learn more about the groups hosting them. 

**Learn more about [hosting events](https://proto.school/#/host)** under our new model, which makes it easier than ever for newcomers to start hosting ProtoSchool workshops based on our interactive [tutorials](https://proto.school/#/tutorials).

*********************************

Welcome to the Beijing chapter of [ProtoSchool](https://proto.school)!

Beijing's Protoschool Chapter is a group of people passionate about all things enabling the **Decentralized Web**. 


We focus on tools **( libp2p \ IPLD \ Mutiformat \ IPFS \ Filecoin )** built by [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/), but also are open to all decentralized compute, storage, and networking technologies!

Join us to learn, to evangelize, to share ideas or just to get to know us.
